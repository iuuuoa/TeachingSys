--------------面向对象文字说明--------------
面向对象式风格借鉴面向对象的思想组织整个系统的高层结构。
面向对象式风格将系统组织为多个独立的对象，每个对象封装其内部的数据，并基于数据对外提供服务。
不同对象之间通过协作机制共同完成系统任务。


--------------关键代码--------------
Input input = new Input();
input.input("E:\\input.txt");
Shift shift = new Shift(input.getLineTxt());
shift.shift();
Alphabetizer alphabetizer = new Alphabetizer(shift.getKwicList());
alphabetizer.sort();
Output output = new Output(alphabetizer.getKwicList());
output.output("E:\\output.txt");
